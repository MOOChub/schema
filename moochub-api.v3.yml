              and via different stations on its way to the target system. The individual
              stations are responsible for ensuring that the message is properly forwarded
              and finally delivered to the correct recipient. Each of these stations,
              if the message is sent in plain text, can receive the message and read
              its content. This means that a potential attacker, if he controls one
              of these intermediate systems, can also read the content of the message
              and even modify it before retransmitting it. Such attacks can have extreme
              effects on communication.</p>\n\n<p>In this course we will look at how
              and whether your connection to online banking is secure or whether the
              content of an e-mail is trustworthy. For this purpose we will deal with
              the basics of cryptography, security objectives and different types
              of encryption. In addition, we will provide insights into different
              models and standards that are used in practice.</p>\n
